### Todo

+ Needs testing: Figure out how to only download x kb from websites (truncate pages) to avoid crawling pages that are huge -- solution, use spray-client. if over limit, returns an error instead
+ Define API interface / json format for chunks to push to client
+ Implement API interface
+ fix invalid API URLs to server so they dont return html
+ fix crawler agents visited url to not be global scope that exists forever (global LRU cache? one
  per session?)
+ refactor webcrawler code into separate library
  * replace all usages of play Akka.system with implicit akka system
  * replace all usages of global ExecutionContext with implicit EC
  * refactor/rename all packages to something more specific from "biz"
+ update to sbt 13
+ update to play 2.2.1


### Notes

+ So yea.. don't shut down Akka.system or restart it, the code for throttling HTTP requests
  relies on it being up, since the throttling mechanism uses akka actors.
