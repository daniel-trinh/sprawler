### Todo

#### Priority 0 (higher is more important)

+ refactor webcrawler code into separate library
  * refactor/rename all packages to something more specific from "biz"
  * separate Build.scala into two separate Build.scala files (one for dead link finding
    specific code, another for webcrawler related code).
+ Define API interface / json format for chunks to push to client
+ Implement API interface
+ fix invalid API URLs to server so they dont return html
+ update to sbt 13
+ update to play 2.2.1, use play-json only when webcrawler code is pulled out

#### Priority 1

+ Needs testing: Figure out how to only download x kb from websites (truncate pages) to avoid crawling pages that are huge -- solution, use spray-client. if over limit, returns an error instead

+ Needs testing: make sure correct exceptions are serialized in certain circumstances

#### Priority 3
+ fix compiler warnings


### Notes

+ So yea.. don't shut down Akka.system or restart it, the code for throttling HTTP requests
  relies on it being up, since the throttling mechanism uses akka actors.
